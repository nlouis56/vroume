Virtual Realm Of Useful Music Evaluation

## Description

VROUME is a Deep Learning music classification system that can classify music into different genres.

Unlike other solutions, VROUME is built around a custom dataset that was created by using user-built playlists from Spotify. This dataset is then used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify music into different genres.
